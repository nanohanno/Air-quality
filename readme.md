## Air-quality

In this project the air quality measured in Berlin is predicted using a recurrent neural network. The model is trained on publicly available particle concentration data of nitrious oxides and weather for one year. Emphasis is put on a strong baseline and critical assessment of the model's precision.

All code and documentation is in a Jupyter notebook. The raw data is contributed for particle densities and weather data.

The requirements.txt file contains information to recreate the conda environment.
